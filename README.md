# Unity Editor Scripts

> I'm using `Unity 6 (6000.0.34f1) Silicon (Mac) LTS`!

Collection of editor scripts I use on a daily basis. I'll do my best to keep this repo as up to date as possible.

## What's Inside

- **Editor Font Size** – Change Unity’s editor font sizes globally or per-style, with persistent settings via JSON snapshots

More scripts that I use will be added over time.

## How to use

Clone the repo and put the `EditorScripts` folder in the `Assets` folder of your project. Voila!

All scripts have a header which explain exactly what they do. Please read it! Thanks :D
